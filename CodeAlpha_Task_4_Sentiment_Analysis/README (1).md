## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze text data from product reviews  
- Classify reviews as Positive, Negative, or Neutral  
- Visualize sentiment distribution  
- Understand customer opinion patterns

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Loaded the dataset using Pandas  
2. Handled missing review values  
3. Calculated sentiment polarity using TextBlob  
4. Classified sentiment based on polarity:
   - Positive → polarity > 0  
   - Negative → polarity < 0  
   - Neutral → polarity = 0  
5. Counted sentiment distribution  
6. Visualized the sentiment results using a bar chart
