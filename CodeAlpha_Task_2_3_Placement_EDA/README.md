# ✅ TASK 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 1️⃣ Meaningful Questions Before Analysis
Before starting the analysis, the following questions were considered:
- What factors influence student placement outcomes?
- Does academic performance impact placement chances?
- Does work experience improve placement probability?
- Is interview score a key deciding factor for placement?
- Are there any anomalies or inconsistencies in the dataset?

---

## 2️⃣ Data Structure Exploration
- The dataset contains **215 student records** with **20 variables**.
- Variables include academic scores, work experience, specialization, interview score, and placement status.
- Both **numerical** and **categorical** data types are present.
- Data types were verified using `.info()` and `.dtypes()`.

---

## 3️⃣ Trends, Patterns & Anomalies
- Students with **higher academic scores** tend to have better placement outcomes.
- **Interview score** shows a strong influence on placement.
- Students with **work experience** have a higher placement rate.
- No major anomalies or outliers were found affecting the analysis.

---

## 4️⃣ Hypothesis Testing & Validation
The following hypotheses were tested:
- Higher academic performance increases placement chances.
- Interview score significantly affects placement outcome.
- Work experience positively impacts employability.

These hypotheses were validated using:
- Statistical summaries
- Correlation analysis
- Box plots and count plots

---

## 5️⃣ Data Quality & Issues
- No missing values were found in the dataset.
- Data was clean and well-structured.
- Categorical variables were handled appropriately during analysis.
- The dataset required no major preprocessing.

---

# ✅ TASK 3: Data Visualization

## 1️⃣ Transforming Data into Visuals
Raw data was transformed into:
- Bar charts
- Box plots
- Count plots
- Correlation heatmap

These visualizations helped simplify complex data relationships.

---

## 2️⃣ Tools Used
- **Python** for data analysis
- **Matplotlib** for basic plotting
- **Seaborn** for advanced and aesthetic visualizations
- **VS Code** as the development environment

---

## 3️⃣ Visual Design for Clarity
- Clear titles and axis labels were added to all charts.
- Appropriate plot types were selected based on data type.
- Color coding was used to clearly differentiate placement status.

---

## 4️⃣ Data Storytelling
The visualizations clearly highlight:
- Placement distribution among students
- Impact of academic performance on placement
- Role of interview scores in placement decisions
- Effect of work experience on employability

These insights support **data-driven decision making**.

---

## 5️⃣ Portfolio Value
This project demonstrates:
- Strong exploratory data analysis skills
- Ability to extract insights from real-world datasets
- Effective data visualization techniques
- Professional use of Python for data analytics

---

## ✅ Conclusion
The combination of **Exploratory Data Analysis** and **Data Visualization** provided meaningful insights into the factors affecting student placements.  
This project fully satisfies **CodeAlpha Task 2 and Task 3 requirements** and strengthens the data analytics portfolio.
